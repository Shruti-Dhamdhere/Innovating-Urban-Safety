Innovating Urban Safety: Advanced Data Analysis of Vehicle Collisions

Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing urban safety by analyzing vehicle collision data from major cities like NYC, Chicago, and Austin. The goal was to identify key accident contributors and present findings through visual dashboards to aid city officials in making informed decisions to improve urban safety.

Key Responsibilities and Techniques

Data Profiling and Analysis:
Conducted detailed data profiling on datasets using Python(Y-data profiling), analyzing relevant variables to ensure data accuracy and completeness.

Data Cleaning and Staging:
Implemented Talend and Alteryx for data cleaning and staging, resulting in a structured dataset and achieving a 60% reduction in data processing time.

ETL Jobs:
Generated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs using Talend to compute accident contributors based on details such as cause, source, time, and location.

Dimensional Modeling:
Developed a dimensional model in E/R Studio and loaded the dimensions and facts into Talend to structure the data appropriately.

Data Visualization:
Created insightful dashboards using Tableau and Power BI for data visualization.

Data Verification:
Verified the accuracy of the portrayed data with SQL database views to ensure reliable reporting.

Results
The project led to a significant reduction in data processing time by 60%, providing timely insights into accident contributors. The developed dashboards facilitated easy interpretation of complex data, aiding city officials in making informed decisions to improve urban safety.
